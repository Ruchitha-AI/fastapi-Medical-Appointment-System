#  FastAPI Medical Appointment System

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Medical Appointment System** is a backend application built using FastAPI that allows managing doctors and appointment workflows efficiently.

This project was developed as part of the FastAPI Internship Program where key backend concepts such as API design, data validation, CRUD operations, workflows, search, sorting, and pagination were implemented.
The system simulates a real-world clinic backend by allowing users to:

* View doctors
* Add, update, and delete doctors
* Book appointments
* Manage appointment status (confirm, cancel, complete)
* Search and filter doctors
* Browse data using sorting and pagination

All APIs are tested using Swagger UI.
